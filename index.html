          <br />
          <h3 style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">Dear friend who wants a better Whole Burnt Offering,</h3>

          <p>I have some questions for you:</p>

          <ul class="questions">
            <li>Do you ever struggle to find <u>pure</u> firstlings without <strong><em>BLEMISH</em></strong> for your Whole Burnt Offering... no matter how much searching you do before getting to the altar?</li>
            <br />
            <li>Have you ever performed a set of Whole Burnt Offerings and then felt pain that you know just wasn't right - your Hands turned white as snow with <strong><em>LEPROSY</em></strong>, or your Eyes were struck with <strong><em>BLINDNESS</em></strong>? Or maybe you busted your ass for a few months... making Whole Burnt Offerings every day - and then an injury occurred that was caused by Sacrificing incorrectly, week after week?</li>
            <br/>
            <li>Do you feel like your Whole Burnt Offering would improve massively and your propitiousness would go through the roof IF you could just get your technique right?</li>
            <br/>
            <li>Are you willing to do <em>whatever</em> it takes to improve your Whole Burnt Offering?</li>
            <br/>
            <li>Do you feel confused about PIACULAR and DEVOTIONAL sacrifice - how to <u>purify</u> the victim, and when to expect expiation?</li>
            <br/>
            <li>Have you practiced your Whole Burnt Offering really hard and then gone to a Sacrifice and bombed at the altar because you couldn't approach <strong style="color:Red"><em>YAHWEH</em></strong>?</li>
            <br/>
            <li>Do you feel that if you developed a MORE RIGHTEOUS Whole Burnt Offering you'd have a massive advantage over your adversaries because of the increase in prosperity and favor? But you're not quite sure how to get your Whole Burnt Offering as PURE as you'd like?</li>
            <br/>
            <li>Have you ever had a famine that's stopped you from Sacrificing for a considerable amount of time? This famine may not have occured while you were Sacrificing, but it prevented you from pleasing the G-d for a while.</li>
            <br/>
            <li>Have you ever approached a Whole Burnt Offering (perhaps a Sacrifice of the firstlings) and felt very nervous before getting to the altar? Maybe these nerves affected the way you approached <strong style="color:Red"><em>YAHWEH</em></strong>?</li>
            <br/>
            <li>Do you want a <strong><em>RIGHTEOUS</em></strong> Whole Burnt Offering?

          </ul>

          <p>
          If you answered "YES!" to any of these questions, then I have some important news for you...</p>
          <p>
          You're NOT alone. In fact, that list of questions was created from years of <strong>personal experience</strong> and from learning about Sacrificing for dozens of sons who I coach.
          </p>

          <h4 style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 18px; color: Red; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Here's The Truth About Whole Burnt Offering...</h4>

          <p>
          If you are leading a nation into battle, or even if you are just a patriarch who wants <em>MILLIONS</em> of descendents... NOT knowing how to Sacrifice correctly is bad.
          </p>
          <p>
          It sucks.
          </p>
          <p>
          It leaves you open to nasty injuries and ETERNAL punishment.
          </p>
          <p>It will stop the G-d from strengthening the Foundation of your seed. </p>

          <p>It could be the thing that stops you succeeding in combat.</p>

          <p>On the other hand...</p>

          <p>KNOWING how to make Whole Burnt Offerings with great technique will let you build superhuman propitiousness, progeny and favor.</p>

          <p>It will make you a better Servant of <strong style="color:Red"><em>YAHWEH</em></strong>.</p>

          <p>In fact, it will make you a better man full stop. Period. Regardless of what you do!</p>

            <!--
          <p>It will lengthen your training career.</p>

          <p>It will adds slabs of muscle to your legs.</p>

          <p>It's WORTH LEARNING how to Squat properly and it's essential for your success regarding your strength training goals.

          <h5 style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 18px; color: Red; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">"Why Should You Listen To Me?"</h5>

          <p>I'm Andy Bolton.</p>

          <p>I'm a Multiple World Champion Powerlifter and Strength Coach from England and I'm one of only a few men to Squat over 1200lbs in competition. In fact, my best ever Squat is <strong>1214lbs (551kg)</strong>...</p>

          <p style="font-style: italic;">Do you want to Squat BIG?</p>
        </div>

        <div style="position: absolute; width: 600px; left: 0px; height: 820px; top: 2540px;">
          <p>
          The simple truth is...</p>

          <p>I have done some massive Squats in competition.</p>

          <p>And I have helped many of my clients improve their Squats, (using techniques that are <span style="background-color: Yellow;">proven to work</span> and
          <STRONG>quick and easy</STRONG> to understand)</p>

          <p>However, I must tell you that it has taken me years to fully understand the Squat and I am still <span style="font-style: italic;">refining and tweaking</span> my own technique now.
          The reason why I do this is simple: </p>

          <p>I want to have as big a Squat as possible and stay as healthy as possible and to do this I need the best technique possible.</p>

          <p>My journey to the top of the Powerlifting world was NOT an easy one. </p>

          <p>I have been training and competing for over 20 years. During that time I have read dozens of books, attended lots of seminars, trained with many Champions and worked with quite a few
          of the World's best strength coaches.</p>

          <p>The bottom line is... It has taken me over 2 decades and thousands of hours of my time to get my knowledge to where it is now.</p>

          <p>The end result has been worth the effort though. I have created a World Class Squat for myself and I like helping my clients take their Squats to the next level. I don't care whether you
          are a rank beginner or an experienced strength athlete... </p>

          <p>I can help you get a <STRONG>STRONG SQUAT</STRONG>.</p>


          <p>
          You know, I have to tell you something:</p>

          <p><STRONG>It's NOT your fault that your Squat isn't as good as you want it to be</STRONG></p>

          <p>In the early part of my strength training career I struggled with my Squat; just like you might be doing now.</p>

          <p>I suffered from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">information overload</span> and sometimes read so much stuff that I didn't know what to do and who to believe. This often left me stuck at the same weight on the Squat for months
          at a time and it also caused me to suffer a couple of nasty injuries.</p>

          <p>Fortunately, over the years I have been able to discover EXACTLY what is required to build a Strong Squat.</p>

          <p>I'm going to share a few of these discoveries with you right now...
          </p>

          <div id="heading">"3 Secrets You Must Know In Order To Develop A Super-Strong Squat..."</div>
          <br /><br />
          <span class="subHeading">Secret #1: The Main Squatting Muscles Are On The Back Of Your Body</span>

          <p>
          Many people think that the Quads are responsible for a big Squat.</p>

          <p>Nothing could be further from the truth. Whilst the Quads are important if you want to Squat big, it is the muscles of the Posterior Chain (back of the body), that
          are most important.</p>

          <p>The muscles most important for a BIG Squat are the Hamstrings, Glutes and Lower Back. </p>

          <p>You must get these muscles brutally strong if you want a huge Squat. And you must learn to Squat with the correct technique that allows you to best use these muscles.</p>

          <p>Correct Squatting technique involves starting your Squats by forcing the knees out. This creates space for your hips on the way down.</p>

          <p>Once you have initiated your Squat by forcing your knees out, you can start to push your Glutes back. Regardless of whether you are Squatting RAW or EQUIPPED, with this
          style of Squatting your shins will stay fairly vertical on the way down and the way up.</p>

          <p>By sitting back on your Squats you will over-load the posterior chain and get those big powerful muscles doing the majority of the work. This will result in a powerful, strong
          Squat that is healthier on the knees than other Squatting styles.
          </p>

          <span class="subHeading">Secret #2: Simple Drills Can Speed Up Your Technical Improvements</span>

          <p>
          Oftentimes people try to correct their Squat technique by thinking of what they need to do during their Squats. For example, they may think to themselves (or have their training
          partners say to them): "Knees out", "sit back" or "chest up" as they are Squatting. This is good, but there are some simple drills you should use to fast-track your road to a
          textbook Squat.</p>

          <p>One of these drills is called the FACE THE WALL SQUAT. I first learnt the Face The Wall Squat from the Russian Kettlebell guy Pavel Tsatsouline.</p>

          <p>This drill can be used in several ways. </p>

          <p>You can use it for 1 or 2 sets of 8 to 12 reps before you Squat (as part of your warm-up).</p>

          <p>You can use it for 1 or 2 sets of 8 to 12 reps after your strength training sessions to get some more practice in on your Squat technique.</p>

          <p>Or, you can do a set every day at home to "grease the groove" and continuously improve your Squat technique. (This will not burn you out as you are only going to use your bodyweight
          for this drill).</p>

          <p>Here's how the Face The Wall Squat works:</p>

          <p>- Stand facing a wall and assume your Squat stance (your toes should be 2 inches from the wall)</p>

          <p>- Perform BODYWEIGHT Squats, focusing on forcing the knees out, sitting back and keeping your upper back arched</p>

          <p><strong>The wall gives you feedback.</strong> For example, if you allow you knees to drift forwards on the way down, your knees will touch the wall and you won't hit depth. If you don't keep your upper
          back arched on the way up, you will hit the wall.</p>

          <p>The Face The Wall Squat is a great learning tool.</p>

          <p>The goal is to be able to Squat to depth with your toes touching the wall. Start using this drill today and be prepared for your Squat technique to improve very quickly. With such
          technical improvements, your Squat numbers will rise and your injury risk will drop - nice.
          </p>

          <span class="subHeading">Secret #3: A Strong Mind Is Essential For A Strong Squat</span>

          <p>
          Having worked with many athletes and guys who want to get STRONG, I can tell you that 80% of most people's problems in the gym are in their head.</p>

          <p>Without a bullet-proof mind-set I could not have Squatted 1214lbs. It takes courage to un-rack that kind of weight and Squat it!</p>

          <p>If you want to achieve your potential on your Squat, you must be strong mentally. DOMINATE the weight, each and every time you Squat... DO NOT let it dominate you.</p>

          <p>Here are some tips that will instantly strengthen the muscle between your ears:</p>

          <p><strong>- Use Visualisation</strong></p>

          <p>Your mind cannot tell the difference between something you strongly imagine and something you have actually done. So if you visualise yourself Squatting a big weight over and over again,
          when you come to actually do it your mind will think you have already done it and you will be much more likely to succeed.</p>

          <p><strong>- Be Aggressive</strong></p>

          <p>When getting ready for you top sets of Squats get a little angry. You must attack the weights with every muscle fiber you have. You can only do this if you are in the right state: fired-up,
          aggressive and focused. </p>

          <p><strong>- Surround Yourself With Good Training Partners</strong></p>

          <p>You must have the right training partners around you if you want to acheive your Squat potential. Get rid of anyone negative and only train with people who inspire you (just make sure
          you give back as much inspiration as you take).</p>
          </p>

          <div id="heading6">"My Challenge To You..."</div>

          <p>Creating a really big Squat is not easy. I'd be lying if I said it was.</p>

          <p>But, let's be honest... every achievment life takes some <STRONG>hard work</STRONG> and getting your Squat to where you want it to be is no different.</p>

          <p>Just imagine a few weeks from now where your Squat could be when you take the information in Explode Your Squat and use it to improve your Squat technique. Iron out all those
          technical problems you have at the moment. Squat more efficiently, more safely and with a more focused mind-set.</p>

          <p><STRONG>STRONG, POWERFUL, ATHLETIC...</STRONG> that's how your Squat will become when you apply my simple, <span style="font-style: italic;">proven</span> and highly effective tips and techniques.</p>

          <p>On the other hand, you could blindly carry on as you are. Uncertain, with BAD HABITS (that will only get worse the more you practice incorrect form). This is a path to
          a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">weak</span> Squat and potential injury</p>

          <p>If you've read this far I know you are SERIOUS about improving your SQUAT and that you'll make the sensible decision to improve your Squat technique and lay the foundation for
          consistent, injury-free strength increases.</p>

          <p>I wish you every success in your quest for a <span style="font-weight: bold;">HUGE Squat.</span> </p>
