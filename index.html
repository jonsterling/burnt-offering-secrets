          <h3 style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">Dear friend who wants a better Whole Burnt Offering,</h3>

          <p>I have some questions for you:</p>

          <ul class="questions">
            <li>Do you ever struggle to find <u>pure</u> firstlings without <strong><em>BLEMISH</em></strong> for your Whole Burnt Offering... no matter how much searching you do before getting to the altar?</li>
            <br />
            <li>Have you ever performed a set of Whole Burnt Offerings and then felt pain that you know just wasn't right - your Hands turned white as snow with <strong><em>LEPROSY</em></strong>, or your Eyes were struck with <strong><em>BLINDNESS</em></strong>? Or maybe you busted your ass for a few months... making Whole Burnt Offerings every day - and then an injury occurred that was caused by Sacrificing incorrectly, week after week?</li>
            <br/>
            <li>Do you feel like your Whole Burnt Offering would improve massively and your propitiousness would go through the roof IF you could just get your technique right?</li>
            <br/>
            <li>Are you willing to do <em>whatever</em> it takes to improve your Whole Burnt Offering?</li>
            <br/>
            <li>Do you feel confused about PIACULAR and DEVOTIONAL sacrifice - how to <u>purify</u> the victim, and when to expect expiation?</li>
            <br/>
            <li>Have you practiced your Whole Burnt Offering really hard and then gone to a Sacrifice and bombed at the altar because you couldn't approach <strong style="color:Red"><em>YAHWEH</em></strong>?</li>
            <br/>
            <li>Do you feel that if you developed a MORE RIGHTEOUS Whole Burnt Offering you'd have a massive advantage over your adversaries because of the increase in prosperity and favor? But you're not quite sure how to get your Whole Burnt Offering as PURE as you'd like?</li>
            <br/>
            <li>Have you ever had a famine that's stopped you from Sacrificing for a considerable amount of time? This famine may not have occured while you were Sacrificing, but it prevented you from pleasing the G-d for a while.</li>
            <br/>
            <li>Have you ever approached a Whole Burnt Offering (perhaps a Sacrifice of the firstlings) and felt very nervous before getting to the altar? Maybe these nerves affected the way you approached <strong style="color:Red"><em>YAHWEH</em></strong>?</li>
            <br/>
            <li>Do you want a <strong><em>RIGHTEOUS</em></strong> Whole Burnt Offering?

          </ul>

          <p>
          If you answered "YES!" to any of these questions, then I have some important news for you...</p>
          <p>
          You're NOT alone. In fact, that list of questions was created from years of <strong>personal experience</strong> and from learning about Sacrificing for my dozens of sons who I coach.
          </p>

          <h4 style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 18px; color: Red; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Here's The Truth About Whole Burnt Offering...</h4>

          <p>
          If you are leading a nation into battle, or even if you are just a patriarch who wants <em>MILLIONS</em> of descendents... NOT knowing how to Sacrifice correctly is bad.
          </p>
          <p>
          It sucks.
          </p>
          <p>
          It leaves you open to nasty injuries and ETERNAL punishment.
          </p>
          <p>It will stop the G-d from strengthening the Foundation of your seed. </p>

          <p>It could be the thing that stops you succeeding in combat.</p>

          <p>On the other hand...</p>

          <p>KNOWING how to make Whole Burnt Offerings with great technique will let you build superhuman propitiousness, progeny and favor.</p>

          <p>It will make you a better Servant of <strong style="color:Red"><em>YAHWEH</em></strong>.</p>

          <p>In fact, it will make you a better man full stop. Period. Regardless of what you do!</p>
